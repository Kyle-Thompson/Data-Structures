Note that currently list.h is the only file worth looking at. The rest are barely built at all.

Notes:
 - if i have a file typedefs.h with the typdefs defined within the ads namespace and then I define a container within the ads namespace, do I still have to specify ads:: when using a typedef? I don't think so and this could save a lot of code duplication.

 - Add an optimization param to all pointer based sequence template definitions.

 - Stop worrying about standard compliance. It was a cool idea initially but now it's just going to hold this back.
